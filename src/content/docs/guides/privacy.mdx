### Mailing List Etiquette

Our mailing lists follow SourceHut's mailing list etiquette. To ensure smooth communication, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Use a Plaintext Mail Supported Client**: We prefer that you use email clients that support plaintext mail. For more information on why this is important and how to set it up, visit [useplaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email).

- **Respect and Professionalism**: Keep the discussions respectful and professional. Constructive criticism and open dialogue are encouraged, but personal attacks or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
