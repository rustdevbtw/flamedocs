## Choose your VCS

Before Contributing, you must choose a VCS. You have *both* Git and Mercurial as an option.  
Both VCS are fully-supported, and have different ways of Contributing.

## Clone

The first obvious thing, is to clone the repo.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Git">
  :::note
  If you plan to use GitHub, you should first [fork](https://github.com/rustdevbtw/flamewolf/fork) the repo, then clone it:

  ```sh title="Clone forked repo"
  git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/flamewolf
  ```

  :::

  ```sh title="Cloning via Git"
  git clone https://github.com/rustdevbtw/flamewolf
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mercurial">
  ```sh title="Cloning via Mercurial"
  hg clone https://hg.sr.ht/~rajdeep/flamewolf
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Making changes

The next step is, of course, to make changes. To know how, refer to the [Firefox source docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org).
We will soon public our own source docs as well, to help with it.

## Submitting patches

This step depends highly on your VCS

### Git

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="via GitHub PR">
      If you're using GitHub, the preferred option is GitHub Pull Request.
      To do so, first push the the changes to your fork, and [create the PR](https://github.com/rustdevbtw/flamewolf/compare).
      We'll soon review your changes, and if we feel that their inclusion is worth it, we'll pull them in.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="via E-Mail PR">
      If you're using some other provider that's not GitHub, you can mail to the [~rajdeep/flamewolf-devel](mailto:~rajdeep/flamewolf-devel@lists.sr.ht) in the following format:
      ```txt title="Sub: PULL [<last commit SHA>] <patch title>"
      Pull: <url>
      VCS: git
      ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Mercurial

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="via E-Mail Patches">
    If you're using Mercurial, then the preferred method is E-Mail Patches. You can mail your patches to [~rajdeep/flamewolf-devel](mailto:~rajdeep/flamewolf-devel@lists.sr.ht). To know how, refer to [`hg-send-mail`](https://man.sr.ht/hg.sr.ht/email.md).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="via E-Mail PR">
    The easiest method with Mercurial is to push your changes to another remote repo (that needs to be in Mercurial), and send a mail to [~rajdeep/flamewolf-devel](mailto:~rajdeep/flamewolf-devel@lists.sr.ht) in the following format:
    ```txt title="Sub: PULL [<last commit rev>] <patch title>"
    Pull: <url>
    VCS: hg
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
